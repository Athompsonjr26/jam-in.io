# jam-in.io
A full-stack project for DigitalCrafts utilizing everything we've learned so far. Our team is going to create a sort of "online rockband" where multiple people can visit a chat room and do real-time collaborative jam sessions.

After our scrum meeting we came up with the following tasks:
* Build the HTML5 canvas to hold the keyboard image
* Find the Web Audio API's that produce the sounds we want
* Reasearch ways to output the sounds produced in a session to MP3 format when done


## Here are screenshots of our meeting
